The manifesto

Take a popular open source ergo keyboard

Feed to a group of nerds

Each nerd makes one change to the design at a time.

These can be:
switch type
peripherals (screen, haptics, audio)
controller
edge cuts
silkscreen
case
firmware features

Each person gets one modification at a time
If a modification falls outside your area of expertise but still have an idea, you can nominate/delegate

Commit your changes back to the forked "canvas" repos- this is why all members are owners.

Have fun!

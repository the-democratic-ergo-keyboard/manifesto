The manifesto

Take a popular open source ergo keyboard

Feed to a group of nerds

Each nerd makes one change to the design at a time.

These can be: <br />
switch type <br />
peripherals (screen, haptics, audio) <br />
controller <br />
edge cuts <br />
silkscreen <br />
case <br />
firmware features <br />

Each person gets one modification at a time
If a modification falls outside your area of expertise but still have an idea, you can nominate/delegate

If a modification is deemed as silly/obstructive to further modiification, then gloss over it or revert it, just like real politics.

Commit your changes back to the forked "canvas" repos- this is why all members are owners.

One person gets one modification, commits, then passes on to the next person in turn.

Have fun!
